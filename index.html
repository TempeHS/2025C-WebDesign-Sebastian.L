    <H3>Aubrey Drake Graham, known mononymously as Drake, is a Canadian rapper and
        singer. An influential figure in contemporary popular music, he has been credited with popularizing R&B

        Next
        Generation (2001–08), Drake pursued a recording career in 2006, releasing his debut mixtape Room for
        Improvement in
        February of that year. He followed up with the mixtapes Comeback Season (2007) and So Far Gone (2009) before
        signing
        with Young Money Entertainment.</H3>
